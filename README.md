# vim-anywhere

This is a fork from [cknadler/vim-anywhere]. Because I'm a neovim user, so I change the run script a little bit.

What you need:
* neovim-gnome-terminal-wrapper


Besides:
If you are an i3wm user, you may want make the neovim-wrapper window floating through this:
```
# vim-anywhere
for_window [class="neovim"] floating enable
```
